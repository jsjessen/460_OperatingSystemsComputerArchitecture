#About

- **School:** Washington State University (WSU) 
- **Course:** CptS 460 - Operating Systems &amp; Computer Architecture
- **Semester:** Spring 2015
- **Goal:** Create a Unix-like operating system capable of running on systems with Intel 80x86 architecture.


#Development Setup

Ubuntu 32 bit

QEMU

bcc, as86, ld86

##Note

- I initially used shell scripts similar to KC's to compile/run everything, but eventually migrated over to Makefiles.
- Labs 7 and 8 were done in a single night, so they might not be perfect.
