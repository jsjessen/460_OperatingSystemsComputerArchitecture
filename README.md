#About

- **School:** Washington State University (WSU) 
- **Course:** CptS 460 - Operating Systems &amp; Computer Architecture
- **Semester:** Spring 2015
- **Goal:** Create a Unix-like operating system capable of running on systems with Intel 80x86 architecture.


#Development Setup

- Ubuntu 32-bit (KC often assumes everyone in the class uses this, so I adopted it for his courses)
- VIM (learning to use it has really paid off)
- QEMU (specifically, qemu-system-i386, but any Virtual Machine *should* work)
- bcc
- as86
- ld86

##Note

- I initially used shell scripts similar to KC's to compile/run everything, but eventually migrated over to Makefiles.
- Labs 7 and 8 were done in a single night, so they might not be perfect.
