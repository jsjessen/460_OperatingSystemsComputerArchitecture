               CS460 NOTES on Multitasking

    No longer limited to 1kb!

0. PRELIMINARY: In CS360 LAB #2, you implemented a 
                printf(char *fmt,...)
function, which can print items as %c, %s, %d, %u, %x, %l. 
As you recall, printf() depends only on putc();

Adapt YOUR printf() to 16-bit real mode by using only putc() of BIOS.

 ==================== in case you forgot HOW =========================
typedef unsigned char  u8;
typedef unsigned short u16;
typedef unsigned long  u32;

#define BASE 10

char *tab = "0123456789ABCDEF";

int rpu(u16 x)
{
  char c;
  if (x){
    c = tab[x % BASE];
    rpu(x/BASE);
    putc(c);
  }
} 

int printu(u16 x)
{
  if (x==0){
    putc('0');
    return;
  }
  rpu(x);
  putc(' ');
}

WRITE YOUR OWN functions:

   int printd(int x): which prints an integer (which may be negative!!)
   int printx(u16 x): which print s in HEX, e.g. a 16-bit address
   int printl(u32 x): which prints x in LONG, e.g. inode and disk block numbers

WRITE YOUR OWN  printf(char *fmt, ...) for formatted printing.

1. Multitasking

    In general, multitasking refers to the ability of performing several 
independent activities at the same time. For example, we often see people 
talking on their cell phones or eating while driving. In a sense, these people 
are doing multitasking, although a very bad kind. In computing, multitasking 
refers to the execution of several independent tasks at the "same time". In a 
uniprocessor (one CPU) system, only one task can execute at a time. Multitasking
is achieved by multiplexing the CPU's execution time among different tasks, i.e.
by switching the CPU execution from one task to another. If the switch is fast 
enough, it gives the illusion that all the tasks are executing simultaneously. 
This logical parallelism is called concurrency. In a multiprocessor system, 
tasks can run on different CPUs in parallel in real time. In addition, each 
processor may also do multitasking by multiplexing its execution time among 
different tasks. Multitasking is the basis of almost all operating systems. It 
is also the basis of concurrent programming in general.

2. The Process Concept
    An operating system is a multitasking system. In an operating system, tasks 
are also called processes. For all practical purposes, the terms task and 
process can be used interchangeably. 

                           PROCESS

   An execution image is a memory area containing the execution's code, data and
stack. CODE DATA STACK (dead until cpu comes to execute, that execution is a process)

            A PROCESS IS THE EXECUTION OF AN IMAGE. 

It is a sequence of executions regarded by the OS kernel as a single entity for
using system resources. System resources include memory space, I/O devices and,
most importantly, CPU time. 

In an OS kernel, each process is represented by a unique data structure, called
the Process Control Block (PCB) or Task Control Block (TCB). In MTX, we shall 
simply call it the PROC structure. Like a personal record, which records all the
information of a person, a PROC structure contains all the information of a 
process. In a single CPU system, only one process can be executing at a time. 
The OS kernel usually uses a PROC pointer, running or current, to point at the
PROC that is currently executing. In a real OS, the PROC structure may contain 
many fields and quite large. To begin with, we shall define a very simple PROC 
structure to represent processes.

       typedef struct proc{
               struct proc *next;
               int         *ksp;
               int         kstack[1024]; // stack pointer points to the end of this
       }PROC; 

In the PROC structure, the next field is a pointer pointing to the next PROC 
structure. It is used to maintain PROCs in dynamic data structures, such as link
lists and queues. The ksp field is the saved stack pointer of a process when it 
is not executing and kstack is the execution stack of a process. As we expand 
the MTX kernel, we shall add more fields to the PROC structure later. 

3. Development of the MTX Kernel

3.1. A Simple Multitasking Program

   We begin to develop the MTX kernel by a simple program, which is used to 
illustrate two important points. First, how do processes in an OS begin? Second,
how does an OS run different processes? The following program, denoted by MTX0,
is similar to a booter. It can be compiled and linked by BCC to generate a 
binary executable, as in 

           as86 -o ts.o  ts.s
           bcc  -c -ansi t.c
           as86 -d -o mtx0 ts.o t.o mtxlib /usr/lib/bcc/libc.a  // ORDER MATTERS

where mtxlib is a link library containing I/O functions based on BIOS. To run 
the mtx0 program, we need a MTX booter, which loads the mtx0 image to the 
segment 0x1000 and then sends the CPU to execute the mtx0 code. Assume that 
FDmtx is a bootable floppy disk image of MTX, i.e. it is an EXT2 file system 
with a MTX booter in block 0. At this moment, the contents of the file system do
not matter. All we need is a boot directory containing a MTX kernel image. 
Mount the FDmtx disk image and copy mtx0 to the boot directory, as in

           mount -o loop FDmtx /mnt  
           cp mtx0  /mnt/boot/mtx0  
           umount   /mnt

We use a bootable FD image mainly for convenience since it can be used directly
on either a real PC or a PC emulator. For example, to boot up and run mtx0 under
QEMU, enter 

           qemu -fda FDmtx -no-fd-bootchk

To run it under DOSEMU or VMware, configure the virtual machine to use FDmtx
as a virtual floppy disk, etc. The following lists the assembly and C code of 
the MTX0 program. The assembly code syntax is that of BCC's as86 assembler.

typedef struct proc{         // process structure
        struct proc *next;   // next PROC pointer
        int  *ksp;           // saved sp when process is not running
        int  kstack[SSIZE];  // per process kernel mode stack

int  procSize = sizeof(PROC);
PROC proc0, *running;        // proc0 structure and running pointer

int scheduler()
{ 
    running = &proc0; 
}

main()
{
  running = &proc0;
  printf("call tswitch()\n"); // Your printf
     tswitch();
  printf("back to main()\n");
}


  During booting, the MTX booter loads mtx0 to the segment 0x1000 and jumps to
there to execute the mtx0 code. When execution starts in ts.s, it sets all 
segment registers to 0x1000 in order to conform to the program's one-segment 
memory model. Then it sets the stack pointer to the high end of proc0, so that 
proc0.kstack is the initial stack area. Up to this point, the system has no 
notion of any process because there is none. Then the assembly code calls main()
in C. When control enters main(), we have an image in execution. By the very 
definition of process, which is the execution of an image, we have a process in 
execution, although the system still does not know which process is executing. 
In main(), after setting running to point at proc0, the system is now running 
the process proc0. This is how a typical OS kernel starts to run an initial 
process when it begins. The initial process is handcrafted or created by brute 
force.
    
    Starting from main(), the run-time behavior of the program can be traced and
explained by the execution diagram of Figure 4.1, in which the key steps are 
labeled (1) to (6).

                  Figure 4.1. Execution Diagram of Proc0

    Assembly code pushes all of the CPU registers (ax, bx, cx, ...)

At (1), it sets running to point at proc0, as shown on the right-hand side of 
the diagram. If we consider proc0 as the PROC structure of a process, the system
is now running the process proc0. 
At (2), it calls tswitch(), which saves the return address, rPC, in stack. 
At (3), it executes the SAVE part of tsiwtch(), which saves CPU registers into 
stack and saves the stack pointer sp into proc0.ksp. 
At (4), it calls scheduler(), which sets running to point at proc0 again. For 
now, this is redundant since running already points at proc0. Then it executes 
the RESUME part of tswitch(). 
At (5), it sets sp to proc0.ksp, which is again redundant because they are 
already the same. Then it pops the stack, which restores the saved CPU registers
At (6), it executes ret at the end of RESUME, which returns to the calling place
of tswitch().

4.3.2. Context Switching

   Besides printing a few messages, the program seems useless since it does 
practically nothing. However, it is the basis of all multitasking programs. To 
see this, assume that we have another PROC structure, proc1, which called 
tswitch() and executed the SAVE part of tswitch() before. Then proc1's ksp must 
point to its stack area, which contains saved CPU registers and a return address
from where it called tswitch(), as shown in the figure 4.2.

 Capitalized Reg mean they belong to Proc1

     Proc1's code space:                            scheduler(): 
     ------------------                                    
          ........;                          proc1 <-- running 
          tswitch();                          ksp        (4)         
              .<------| proc1 SAVED registers  |         
          ........;   |                        |
   proc1 -------------|------------------------|------
   stack:|stackframe|RPC|AX|BX|CX|DX|BP|SI|DI|FLAG|
         --------------------------------------------- 
                       |(6)|  <=== pop stack      sp <== (5) RESUME: 

                Figure 4.2. Execution Diagram of Proc1

    In scheduler(), if we let running point to proc1, as shown in the right-hand
side of the figure, the RESUME part of tswitch() would change sp to proc1's ksp.
Then the RESUME code would operate on the stack of proc1. This would restore the
saved registers of proc1, causing proc1 to resume execution from where it called
tswitch() earlier. This changes the execution environment from proc0 to proc1.

                    Context Switching: 

 Changing the execution environment of one process to that of another is called 
 context switching, which is the basic mechanism of multitasking.



2. A Simple Multi-tasking System

    With context switching, we can create a multitasking environment containing
many processes. In the next program, denoted by MTX4.1, we define NPROC = 9 PROC
structures, each representing a process. Each PROC has a unique pid number for 
identification and a kstack, which is the execution stack of the process. The 
PROCs are initialized as follows.

each process runs in kernel space, but can also switch to user mode
if program at 0x1000, 0x2000 through 0x8000 (or is it 0x9000?) available for RAM

singularly linked list (circular), P8 points back to P0
pretend P0->p8 have called tswitch() sometime before 

        running -> P0 -> P1 -> P2 -> P3 ->....-> P8->|                
                   |                                 |
                   <------------------------------<---

 P0 is the initial running process. All the PROCs form a circular link list for
simple process scheduling. Each of the PROCs, P1 to P8, is initialized in such 
a way that it is ready to resume running from a body() function. Since the 
initialization of the PROC stack is crucial, we explain the steps in detail. 
Although the processes never existed before, we may pretend that they not only 
existed before but also ran before. The reason why a PROC is not running now is
because it called tswitch() and gave up CPU earlier. If so, the PROC's ksp must
point to its stack area containing saved CPU registers and a return address, as
shown in Figure 4.3.

   proc.kstack  |-1  -2  -3  -4  -5  -6  -7  -8  -9  | 
                --------------------------------------------
   High address |rPC|ax |bx |cx |dx |bp |si |di |flag|
                --|-------------------------------|---------                   
                 code                          proc.ksp

                  Figure 4.3. Process Stack Contents

   Since the PROC never really ran before, we may assume that its stack was 
initially empty, so that the return address, rPC, is at the very bottom of the 
stack. What should be the rPC?  It may point to any executable code, e.g. the 
entry address of a body() function. What about the "saved" registers? Since the
PROC never ran before, the register values do not matter, so they can all be 
initialized to 0. Accordingly, we initialize each of the PROCs, P1 to P8, as 
shown in Figure 4.4.

                                              ----------

                Figure 4.4. Initial Stack Contents of a Process

With this setup, when a PROC becomes running, i.e. when running points to the 
PROC, it would execute the RESUME part of tswitch(), which restores the "saved"
CPU registers, causing the execution to return to the beginning of the body() 
function. 

    After initialization, P0 calls tswitch() to switch process. In tswitch(), P0
saves CPU registers into its own stack, saves the stack pointer into its 
PROC.ksp and calls scheduler(). The scheduler() function simply changes running 
to running->next. So P0 switches to P1. P1 begins by executing the RESUME part 
of tswitch(), causing it to resume to the body() function. While in body(), the 
running process prints its pid and prompts for an input char. Then it calls 
tswitch() to switch to the next process, etc. Since the PROCs are in a circular
link list, they will take turn to run. The assembly code is the same as before,
except for the initial stack pointer, which is set to proc[0]'s kstack when 
execution begins, as in
